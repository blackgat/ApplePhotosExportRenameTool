***
### objective
Used to help rename the export folders from Photos app to date only format

### How to get started
Launch program and following the button description to do the corresponding work.

### Known limitation
 - It only worked for folders with chinese words. Need to modify code for other cases.
 - You need to download [ExifTool](https://www.sno.phy.queensu.ca/~phil/exiftool/) and put it with the program in the same folder. Remember to rename the downloaded execution file from "exiftool(-k).exe" to "exiftool.exe".
